# UBER-SQL-project
The primary goal of this project is to leverage SQL to gain a deeper understanding of the UBER business insights through strategic queries and analysis. 
  - Identify patterns in ride requests and driver performance.
  - Uncover trends that can optimize the operational efficiency of the service.
  - Provide data-driven insights to enhance customer experience and satisfaction.
  - Offer actionable recommendations to improve overall service delivery.
**Key Insights and Solutions**
Using SQL, we are able to:
  - **Streamline operations** by analyzing ride frequency, peak times, and geographic hotspots.
  - **Enhance driver performance** by assessing ratings, trip completion rates, and earnings.
  - **Improve customer experience** by identifying trends in passenger preferences, wait times, and ride durations.
Through this project, I aim to not only demonstrate technical SQL skills but also show how data-driven insights can directly contribute to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of a ride-hailing service like Uber.
